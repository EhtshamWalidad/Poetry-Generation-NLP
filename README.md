# Poetry-Generation-NLP

Given a csv file that contains 43 rows (poets) and 2 columns (Names ,Poems).
We use that data and create a Bigram Model and a Trigram Model and use CFD (Commulative frequency Distribution) to predict the next word.
For rhyming we check probabilities of rhyming or else we place the previous verse ending word same as it is to rhyme.
Not only this we also applied a Backward bigram, Backward Trigram and also Bidirectional Bigram and trigram.
